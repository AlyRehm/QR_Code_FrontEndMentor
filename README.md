## My process
In the development process, I initiated by carefully examining the provided design image to grasp the project's visual direction. Starting with the outermost details, I methodically progressed inward, ensuring attention to every aspect. Utilizing Figma for design insights, I precisely determined the color palette to be employed throughout the project.

Beginning with the layout, I structured the interface by creating a white box to contain the QR code and accompanying text. Initially, I organized this box into three separate divs: one for the QR code image, another for the header, and the third for the paragraph content. However, during the formatting phase, I opted to refine the structure. Recognizing the necessity for precise spacing adjustments around the text, I separated the textual content into its dedicated div. This adjustment facilitated more accurate alignment and enhanced visual appeal.

Throughout the process, I continuously iterated on the layout and formatting, ensuring consistency and responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes. The finalization phase encompassed a comprehensive review to ensure alignment with design specifications and functional integrity. This meticulous approach ensured the creation of a polished and professional interface.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned
Working on this project reignited my passion for frontend development. It reminded me of the joy I find in creating user interfaces with HTML and CSS. Through this experience, I've reaffirmed the importance of hands-on practice in honing coding skills and cultivating good coding habits.

One major takeaway from this project is the significance of attention to detail. Small adjustments in layout and formatting can significantly enhance the overall user experience. For instance, separating text content into dedicated divs allowed for more precise spacing adjustments, leading to improved visual appeal and readability.

Moreover, this project served as a reminder of the importance of continuous learning and growth. Despite having prior experience in frontend development, there were still new techniques and approaches to explore. By delving into this project, I've expanded my skill set and gained a deeper understanding of frontend development principles.

Moving forward, I am excited to apply the lessons learned from this project to future endeavors. I am committed to dedicating more time to frontend development, as it aligns with my true passion for coding. By consistently working on projects like this, I am confident that I will continue to refine my skills and achieve my goals in the field of frontend development.



### Continued development
I want to continue working with Flexbox. I used to have a really good understanding of the concept and how to use it. I realized I am out of practice and want to get back to making responsive frontend designs. 

I was having trouble getting the spacing around my copy to work, and I am not 100% happy with how I was able to make it work. But it works. I would like to come back to this after I start getting back into the swing of things and modify some of my code to get the spacing to work without adding margin-bottom.
